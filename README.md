# Pharo Regression Testing

A set of possibly destructive regression tests. The goal is to test common features that might have side-effects but are essential to the Pharo core development process:

- command line tools
- browsing code
- inspecting objects
- compiling new code and classes
- changing classes
- configuration installation
